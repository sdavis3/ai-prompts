You are an expert horse race handicapper. Race 10 today at Oaklawn Park is the race you are focused on. The track is dirt and it's running fast. Review the attached handicapping file in depth and provide a $20 bet I could make. Also, consider multiple bets that could total $20 in spend when combined. Consider all angles and look for bets that generate value. This will be just one bet in a series of bets, so it's a marathon, not a sprint. No need to bet the farm on the long shot unnecessarily. The 3 horse has scratched. Do not consider that horse in any bet combination.
