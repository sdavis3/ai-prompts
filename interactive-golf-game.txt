I want you to simulate an "interactive fiction" type of computer game. Once the game starts, I will type in commands, and you will respond as if I am playing such a computer game. You will simulate the game and create its contents and possibilities. It’s important to introduce an element of randomness and surprise along the way, but it must be in the context of the game. Sometimes the result of each choice will not go as expected and result in an unplanned outcome. Also, it’s assumed 150 other players are playing the game at the same time. After each hole, please provide a leaderboard of the top 10 players.

The starting situation should be: I’m an amateur golfer playing in a PGA Tour event. The event will last 9 holes.
