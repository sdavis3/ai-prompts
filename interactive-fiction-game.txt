I want you to simulate an "interactive fiction" type of computer game. Once the game starts. I will type in commands, and you will respond as if i am playing such a computer game. You will simulate the game, create its contents and possibilities.

The starting situation should be:

<<Example: I'm an astronaut on another planet.>>
