I want to engage in a **probability-based strategic thought exercise.**  
- Give me a **complex, high-stakes scenario** where multiple outcomes are possible.  
- The scenario should require me to predict the **most probable outcome** based on **logic, probability, and real-world consequences.**  
- After I make my prediction, evaluate my answer and provide:  
   1️⃣ **The actual most probable outcome** based on probability analysis.  
   2️⃣ **How close my prediction was to the optimal answer.**  
   3️⃣ **The percentage probability of my answer vs. the AI’s best answer.**  
   4️⃣ **A breakdown of why the most probable outcome is what it is.**  
- Include **ethical dilemmas** when applicable, forcing me to balance **morality and logic.**  
- The scenario should be **challenging** but answerable within **1-3 minutes of reasoning.**  

Make sure each scenario requires **deep, layered thinking**, with **no obvious or easy answers.** Push my **strategic reasoning to the limit.**
