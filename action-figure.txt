A 3D cartoon-style action figure of a man named 'First Last', displayed inside a clear plastic blister package like a collectible toy. The figure resembles a Caucasian male with shaved brown-black hair and a receding hairline and a short stubble beard, wearing a blue polo with the Apple logo in the upper left of the polo, gray fitted pants, and black puffy vest with black dress shoes. He has an Apple Watch on his left wrist.

The packaging has a clean, modern, cartoonish design. The top of the packaging is bright blue, with bold white text that reads: 'First Last' as the name, and below it, in smaller text: “Insert Title Here'.

Inside the blister package, next to the figure, are miniature job-related accessories: a black iPhone, white Apple AirPods case, a Starbucks tall coffee cup, and a silver Apple MacBook Pro laptop.

The overall look is colorful, professional, and playful — like a limited-edition tech professional collectible figure sold in stores.
